The Formula: 
- Length in mm (L):	The length of the panel. 
- Width in mm (W):	The width of the base panel front to back. 
- Height in mm (H):	The overall depth of water that is in contact with the glass. 
- Thickness in mm (t):	The thickness of the panel. 
- Water Pressure (p):	The force in Newton’s (N). 
- Allowed Bending Stress (B):	Tensile Strength / Safety Factor 
- Modulus of Elasticity (E):	Elastic Strength The length to height ratio effects the strength of the glass. 

The table below lists alpha and beta constants to be used in the formula.

For Main Panels	For Bottom Panels Ratio of L/H	Alpha	Beta	Alpha	Beta 0.5	0.003	0.085 0.666 0.0085	0.1156 1.0 0.022 0.16 0.077	0.453 1.5 0.042	0.26	0.0906	0.5172 2.0 0.056	0.32	0.1017	0.5688 2.5 0.063	0.35	0.111	0.6102 3.0	0.067	0.37	0.1335 0.7134 

When the ratio is less than 0.5, use Alpha and Beta values for 0.5.

When the ratio is greater than 3, use Alpha and Beta values for 3.

Note: For bottom panel, use Length to Width ratio (L/W).

The water pressure (p) is directly proportional to the Height (H) x the force of gravity = 9.81.

p = H x 10 in N/mm2

The bending stress allowed (B) is equal to the Tensile Strength of glass / safety factor.

B = 19.2 / 2 = 9.60N/mm2 (Safety factor = 2)

B = 19.2 / 3.8 = 5.05N/mm2 (Safety factor = 3.8)

B = 19.2 / 5 = 3.84N/mm2 (Safety factor = 5)

B = 19.2 / 6.8 = 2.82N/mm2 (Safety factor = 6.8)

The thickness of the glass (t) is proportional to the (square root of width factor (beta) x height (H) cubed x 0.00001 / allowable bending stress (B)).

so; t = SQR (beta x H3 x 0.00001 / 9.60) in mm.

so; t = SQR (beta x H3 x 0.00001 / 5.05) in mm.

so; t = SQR (beta x H3 x 0.00001 / 3.84) in mm.

so; t = SQR (beta x H3 x 0.00001 / 2.82) in mm.

Select beta and alpha from the previous chart based on the length to height ratio. The deflection of the glass is proportional to

(alpha x water pressure (p) x 0.000001 x Height4) (Modulus of elasticity (E) x Thickness (t) cubed).

Deflection = (Alpha x p x 0.000001 x H4) / (69000 x t3) in mm.

Bottom Panels: If the aquarium base is completely supported and has polished edges then you can use a base thickness equal to the thickness of the largest panel that has been calculated with a safety factor of 2. If you want the base to be self supporting then you would need to calculate this. Beta is now calculated from the Length/Width (where the length L is the larger dimension, therefore L/W is always >=1). The Height is still used to calculate the pressure. Ensure you use the Bottom Panel Alpha/Beta values. The safety factor is always 3.8.

The thickness of the bottom glass (t) is proportional to the square root of width factor (beta) x height (H) cubed x 105 / allowable bending stress (B), – the same as the side panels.

t = SQR (beta x H3 x 0.00001 / 5.05) in mm

Select beta and alpha from the previous chart based on the length to width ratio.

The deflection of the glass is proportional to (alpha x water pressure (p) x 10-6 x Height4) / (Modulus of elasticity (E) x Thickness (t)cubed).

Deflection = (Alpha x p x 0.000001 x H4) / (69000 x t3) in mm.
